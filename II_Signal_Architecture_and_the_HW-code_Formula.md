# II. Signal Architecture and the HW-code Formula

## 2.1 General Concept of Computation

The Signal Theory of Being (STB) is based on the postulate that all computational dynamics emerge from the interactions between input signals and a set of independent blocks, each capable of reacting to a signal when its phase structure matches.

## 2.2 Core Formula

The fundamental signal-block execution cycle is:

```text
Signal → Block → Reaction → Signal*
````

Where:

* `Signal` — the incoming excitation, defined by type, form, and phase.
* `Block` — a structural unit capable of reacting when the signal’s form and phase match its internal parameters.
* `Reaction` — the block’s response, generating new signals or modifying the incoming one.
* `Signal*` — a set of new signals sent to other blocks, or the same signal reinterpreted through the block.

## 2.3 Principle of Block Excitation

Each block has its own intrinsic phase and form. Excitation occurs only if the incoming signal meets the following conditions:

* The signal’s type is within the block’s accepted types.
* The form-factor `f` (matching metric between signal and block) exceeds a defined threshold `θ`.
* The phase of the signal falls within the resonance zone relative to the block’s phase.

## 2.4 Extended Model (Multiple Excitations)

```text
Signal → ∑{Block_i | f_i ≥ θ} → ∑Reaction_i → Signal{n}
```

This means:

* A single signal is broadcasted to all blocks in parallel.
* Only blocks with sufficient phase/form match respond.
* Multiple reactions and resulting signals may emerge concurrently.

## 2.5 Architectural Properties

* **Field-based Broadcasting**: every signal is simultaneously transmitted to all blocks in the system.
* **Local Reactivity**: blocks do not communicate directly, they react independently based on signal match.
* **Superposition**: multiple blocks may react to a single signal, forming competing or cooperative responses.
  If blocks are defined in the same signal field, a phase match with one block can instantaneously excite others — similar to “quantum entanglement” or a digital Higgs field.
* **Cyclic Behavior**: output signals can recursively become new inputs, forming closed-loop chains.

## 2.6 Behavioral Examples

### Example A: Threshold-Based Response

* Signal: {type: "input", payload: "stimulus", phase: α}
* Phase and form match with block B1 → excitation
* Reaction: emits new signal {type: "response", payload: "motion"}

### Example B: Cascading Activation via Signal and Mass

* Input signal: {type: "temperature", payload: "T = 100°C", phase: Φ₃}

This signal excites 3 blocks:
• `B_heatSensor` (reaction: {type: "alert", payload: "overheat"})
• `B_logger` (reaction: {type: "log", payload: "T=100°C"})
• `B_thermalHistory` (reaction: memory accumulation)

The combined mass of these three reactions (in phase and type) activates two additional blocks:
• `B_overheatPredictor` (reaction: {type: "prediction", payload: "possible failure"})
• `B_coolingTrigger` (reaction: {type: "activation", payload: "turn on cooling"})

> The system's behavior emerges not from a single signal, but from the **cumulative activation of reactions**, creating a cascade.
