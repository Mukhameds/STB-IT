# VI. Implementation of Reactive Systems

## 6.1 Basic Execution Scheme

In STB, there is no centralized controller or main execution thread.  
The system is built entirely on a signal-reactive architecture:

* The system contains a large set of blocks in memory (or distributed across nodes)  
* Each incoming signal is simultaneously visible to all blocks  
* Blocks independently check for matches against their configuration  
* Reactions generate new signals, closing the computation loop

## 6.2 Signal and Block Containers

In practice, signals and blocks are stored and processed using the following structures:

* `SignalQueue[]` — queue of active signals  
* `BlockMap{Phase → []Blocks}` — mapping from phase keys to block lists for efficient lookup  
* `FantomField[]` — list of active phantoms with their mass and lifetime

## 6.3 System Cycle (Signal Engine)

```go
while true {
  signal := dequeue(SignalQueue)
  for block in BlockMap[signal.Phase] {
    if match(signal, block) {
      reaction := block.React(signal)
      enqueue(SignalQueue, reaction...)
    }
  }
  updateFantomField(signal)
  decayInactiveBlocks()
}
````

## 6.4 Asynchronous Execution Support

Blocks can execute in parallel or independently:

* Multi-threaded block processing is supported
* Phantoms can emit signals in parallel phases
* Signals are processed independently — reaction order is non-critical

## 6.5 Temporal Mechanisms

Each signal and block may carry temporal attributes:

* `ttl` — time-to-live for a signal
* `delay` — delay before block reaction is executed
* `expire` — expiration time for block activity
* `cooldown` — refractory period before a block can be re-excited

These features enable modeling of reflexes, adaptation, fatigue, and attention focus.

## 6.6 Example of System Initialization

```go
init(SignalQueue)
load(BlockMap)
loop Engine:
  process signals
  generate reactions
  apply decay
```

```
