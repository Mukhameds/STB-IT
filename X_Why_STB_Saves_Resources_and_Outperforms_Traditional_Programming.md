# X. Why STB Saves Resources and Outperforms Traditional Programming

## 10.1 Signal Addressing Without Global Scanning

In STB architecture, signals are **not broadcast to all blocks indiscriminately**. Instead, phase-based routing is used:

```text
PhaseSet ‚Üí BlockMap
````

This functions like a hash table or indexed addressing in databases. Even with millions of blocks, the system activates **only those** whose phase matches the signal ‚Äî eliminating redundancy and reducing computational load to a **constant time (O(1))**.

## 10.2 Local Reactivity and Full Decentralization

Each block:

* Is triggered independently;
* Reacts only to matching phase and form;
* Requires no global scheduler or synchronization.

This enables:

* Natural block-level parallelism;
* Scalable behavior without central control;
* Reduced overhead from context switching and calls.

## 10.3 Resource Efficiency Comparison

| Approach          | Cost Growth w/ Scale  | CPU/Memory Usage | Scalability |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| OOP / Procedural  | Linear                | High             | Low         |
| Actor Model       | Queue-bound           | Medium           | Moderate    |
| Reactive Streams  | Link-dependent        | Medium           | Moderate    |
| **STB (HW-code)** | Local, phase-directed | Low (O(1))       | **High**    |

## 10.4 Quantified Resource Savings

* **No global lookup** ‚Äî CPU savings at scale
* **No frequent context switches** ‚Äî saves cache lines and runtime
* **Phantoms and TTLs** ‚Äî suppress noise without manual cleanup
* **Phase routing** ‚Äî avoids redundant block access

## 10.5 Conclusion

**STB is inherently an energy-efficient, loosely coupled architecture**, where computation occurs through **local resonances** rather than global algorithms. This makes it:

* Faster
* More scalable
* More economical in memory, CPU, and network resources

üëâ For distributed systems, sensor networks, edge devices, and autonomous AI ‚Äî STB is a **natural and technically justified choice**.

# Glossary of STB Terms

| Term                | Definition                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Signal**          | The basic unit of information transmission in STB. Contains a type, payload, and phase key for addressing.         |
| **Phase**           | Key used for phase-based excitation. Not a float, but a symbolic marker (e.g. `Œ¶‚ÇÅ`, `Œ¶_alert`) for signal routing. |
| **FormShape**       | Structural form of a signal or block ‚Äî describes features used in matching.                                        |
| **Form-Factor (f)** | Measure of similarity between signal and block forms. A block activates when `f ‚â• Œ∏`.                              |
| **Block**           | Reactive computational unit that responds to matching signal phase and form. Contains reaction rules.              |
| **Reaction**        | Block‚Äôs output in response to excitation. Can be a new signal or a modified one.                                   |
| **Phantom**         | Temporary or emergent construct formed from cumulative signal mass. Not a physical block, but can influence flow.  |
| **Mass**            | Combined strength of signals and reactions that determine phantom emergence or persistence.                        |
| **Threshold (Œ∏)**   | Sensitivity limit. Blocks ignore signals if `f < Œ∏`.                                                               |
| **SignalQueue**     | Queue of active signals to be processed by the system.                                                             |
| **BlockMap**        | Mapping of phases to block lists for fast access.                                                                  |
| **FantomField**     | Set of currently active phantoms, including their mass, phase, and lifetime.                                       |
| **Cooldown**        | Period during which a block cannot be reactivated after firing.                                                    |
| **Decay**           | Mechanism for gradual decrease in value (state, mass, or phantom strength).                                        |
| **TTL**             | Time to live ‚Äî signals expire after this period.                                                                   |
| **Superposition**   | Coexistence of multiple active blocks or phantoms that affect the signal network simultaneously.                   |
| **InhibitWindow**   | Post-activation period during which the block is inhibited. Represents suppression behavior.                       |
| **PhaseSet**        | Set of phases a block is tuned to. Signals outside this set are ignored.                                           |
| **ReactionFn**      | Internal function defining what output a block produces when excited.                                              |
