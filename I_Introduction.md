# I. Introduction to the Signal-Based Paradigm (STB)

## 1.1 Purpose of This Document

This document presents the technical specification of a new computational paradigm — **Signal Theory of Being (STB)**.  
It is designed to build reactive, scalable, and self-organizing systems as an alternative to classical programming models such as OOP and functional programming.

## 1.2 Context and Motivation

Modern programming paradigms are constrained by linear execution logic and centralized control structures.  
This limits their ability to model distributed reactive systems, handle dynamic context, enable adaptive behavior, and support internal evolution of software structures.

STB introduces a novel computational model where system behavior is not defined by sequential commands, but by the **interaction between signals and reactive blocks**.

## 1.3 Areas of Application

STB can be applied to a wide range of domains:

* Construction of cognitive and intelligent systems  
* Reactive environments and agent-based platforms  
* Robotics and autonomous systems  
* Distributed mesh networks  
* Signal-based modeling of physical processes  
* New approaches to machine reasoning and memory

## 1.4 Distinction from Traditional Paradigms

| Criterion             | Classical Paradigms          | Signal-Based Paradigm (STB)          |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Execution Logic       | Linear (main loop, method calls) | Distributed, field-based reaction   |
| Control Structure     | Central thread / object        | Absent — behavior is emergent       |
| Processing Unit       | Object, function               | Reactive block                      |
| Behavior Trigger      | Method call, condition         | Signal-phase resonance in block     |
| Memory Model          | Data structures                | Excited blocks with form-factor     |
| Learnability          | Via external ML modules        | Built-in via signal dynamics        |
