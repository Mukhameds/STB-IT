# Signal Theory of Being (STB) — Computational Paradigm

This repository contains the formal documentation of the **Signal Theory of Being (STB)** — a novel computational architecture for reactive, decentralized, and scalable systems.  
It proposes an alternative to traditional programming paradigms (OOP, functional, actor model) by introducing signal-phase logic and emergent computation through localized reactions.

## 🔍 Key Concept

STB is based on the formula:

```

Signal → Block → Reaction → Signal\*

```

Where computation emerges through **signal-phase matching** and **distributed excitation** of blocks, rather than sequential instructions or message passing.

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Signal-driven logic**: All system activity is triggered by incoming signals matched by phase and form.
- **No central controller**: Blocks act independently and react only if phase and form match thresholds.
- **Emergent dynamics**: Phantom structures and feedback loops support superposition, decision making, and state competition.
- **Phase-based addressing**: Signals are routed and filtered via symbolic `PhaseKey`, not numerical floats or global IDs.

## ⚙️ Implementation Formats

- STB is language-agnostic and can be implemented in:
  - Go (reference logic engine)
  - FPGA / ASIC signal-phase logic
  - WebAssembly
  - Mesh-networked agents

## 🧪 Status

This repository is part of an ongoing research initiative.  
STB is not a metaphor or neural heuristic — it is a deterministic, signal-phase computational architecture, suitable for:

- AI systems beyond neural nets  
- Context-aware robotics  
- Sensor-driven platforms  
- Self-evolving control logic  
- Mathematical computation via phase resonance
