# V. Phantom Logic and Superposition

## 5.1 What Is a Phantom

A *phantom* is a temporary or emergent structure that arises within the system as a result of combined signals and reactions.  
It does not correspond to any fixed physical block. A phantom represents a *virtual excitation* that exists as long as its supporting signal mass is sustained.

Characteristics of phantoms:

* No fixed position in memory or space  
* Not explicitly declared in code  
* Can emerge, merge, or decay dynamically

## 5.2 Conditions for Phantom Emergence

A phantom emerges when:

* Multiple signals excite a related set of blocks  
* The combined reaction surpasses a defined threshold of mass or phase  
* A stable loop or excitation cloud forms

## 5.3 Phantom Functionality

A phantom can:

* Modify signals in transit (via phantom filtering)  
* Generate its own signals in mixed or derived phases  
* Influence blocks as if it were a true signal source, despite having no physical representation

## 5.4 Principle of Superposition

Multiple phantoms can coexist within the same field or environment.  
Their interactions follow rules such as:

* **Constructive interference** (amplification)  
* **Destructive interference** (mutual cancellation)  
* **Phase harmony or conflict** (resonance or breakdown)

Phantom superposition allows the system to maintain multiple hypotheses, states, or reactions in parallel, without immediate resolution.

## 5.5 Scenario: Decision Making via Phantoms

The system receives an ambiguous signal. As a result, two phantoms are formed:

* Phantom: “interpret as a threat”  
* Phantom: “interpret as an error”

Both are active and compete, activating different chains of blocks. Final resolution is based on:

* **Phantom mass** — the amount of supporting signal energy  
* **Phase strength** — alignment with the current context  
* **Timer** — duration of active phase retention

## 5.6 Phantom Dissolution

A phantom dissipates if:

* The flow of supporting signals stops  
* Its mass drops below the activation threshold  
* A suppressing phantom emerges with an antagonistic phase

Phantoms are transient yet meaningful entities in signal-based architecture.  
They enable modeling of ambiguity, decision-making, uncertainty, and state competition in a fully reactive system.
